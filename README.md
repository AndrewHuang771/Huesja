The single player isn't the focus (it's basically one person multiplayer), so we'll assume they pressed multiplayer:

Once they've choosen their instrument, they'll be able to either create or join a room.

Once you either enter the room code and press join or create a room, you'll be directed to a room that looks like one of the following:

When you play, your name will change color and the other people in the room will be able to hear your sound and you'll be able to hear their's.
